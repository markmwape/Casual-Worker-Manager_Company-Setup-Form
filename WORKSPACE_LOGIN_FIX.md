# Workspace Login Fix

## Problem
Users were being sent to the wrong workspace after login when they entered a workspace code. The workspace code entered on the workspace selection page was not being properly passed through the authentication flow.

## Root Cause
There was a **storage key mismatch** across different parts of the application:

1. **workspace_selection.html** stored workspace data in `localStorage` with key `'pendingWorkspace'`
2. **signin.js** looked for workspace data in `sessionStorage` with key `'pending_workspace'`
3. **finishSignIn.js** looked for workspace data in `localStorage` with key `'pendingWorkspace'`
4. The workspace code passed via URL parameter was not being read properly in **finishSignIn.js**

This caused the workspace selection to be lost during the login process, resulting in users being redirected to the wrong workspace (typically their first workspace or a random one).

## Solution

### 1. Fixed workspace_selection.html
Changed storage mechanism from `localStorage` to `sessionStorage` to maintain consistency:

**Before:**
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('pendingWorkspace', JSON.stringify(data.workspace));
```

**After:**
```javascript
sessionStorage.setItem('pending_workspace', JSON.stringify(data.workspace));
```

This was done in two places:
- Join workspace form submission
- Create workspace form submission

### 2. Enhanced finishSignIn.js
Added comprehensive workspace resolution with the following priority order:

1. **First priority: URL parameter** - Check for `workspace` parameter in URL (passed from email sign-in link)
2. **Second priority: sessionStorage** - Check `pending_workspace` key
3. **Third priority: localStorage** - Check `pendingWorkspace` key (backward compatibility)
4. **Last resort: Auto-select** - Fetch user's workspaces and auto-select the first one

**Key improvements:**
- Added URL parameter reading: `urlParams.get('workspace')`
- Added API call to fetch workspace details by code when found in URL
- Added fallback to sessionStorage with key `'pending_workspace'`
- Maintained backward compatibility with localStorage
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Clear both localStorage and sessionStorage after successful login

### 3. Maintained signin.js compatibility
The signin.js file already properly:
- Reads from `sessionStorage` with key `'pending_workspace'` ✓
- Passes workspace code in URL for email sign-in ✓
- Sends workspace data to `/set_session` endpoint ✓

## Files Modified

1. **templates/workspace_selection.html**
   - Line ~517: Changed `localStorage.setItem('pendingWorkspace', ...)` to `sessionStorage.setItem('pending_workspace', ...)`
   - Line ~606: Changed `localStorage.setItem('pendingWorkspace', ...)` to `sessionStorage.setItem('pending_workspace', ...)`

2. **static/js/finishSignIn.js**
   - Added URL parameter reading for workspace code
   - Added API call to fetch workspace details by code
   - Added sessionStorage reading with proper key
   - Added comprehensive fallback mechanism
   - Enhanced logging for debugging
   - Clear both storage types after successful login

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: Join Existing Workspace with Google Sign-In
1. Go to workspace selection page
2. Enter a valid workspace code
3. Click "Join Workspace"
4. Click "Sign in with Google"
5. **Expected:** User should be redirected to the correct workspace (matching the entered code)

### Test Case 2: Join Existing Workspace with Email Sign-In
1. Go to workspace selection page
2. Enter a valid workspace code
3. Click "Join Workspace"
4. Enter email and click "Send Sign-in Link"
5. Click the link in the email
6. **Expected:** User should be redirected to the correct workspace (matching the entered code)

### Test Case 3: Create New Workspace
1. Go to workspace selection page
2. Fill out the "Create New Workspace" form
3. Click "Create Workspace"
4. Sign in (either method)
5. **Expected:** User should be in the newly created workspace

### Test Case 4: Forgot Workspace Feature
1. Use the "Forgot workspace code?" feature
2. Sign in and select a workspace
3. **Expected:** User should be in the selected workspace

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Consistent storage** - All files now use the same storage keys
2. ✅ **URL parameter support** - Workspace code can be passed via URL (email sign-in)
3. ✅ **Multiple fallbacks** - System tries multiple sources before giving up
4. ✅ **Backward compatibility** - Old localStorage keys still work
5. ✅ **Better logging** - Enhanced debugging information
6. ✅ **Proper cleanup** - Both storage types cleared after successful login

## Additional Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility with existing implementations
- Email sign-in now properly passes workspace code via URL parameter
- sessionStorage is more appropriate than localStorage for temporary workspace selection
- The system gracefully handles cases where no workspace is specified
- All error scenarios are properly logged for debugging
